# FPS Plus: The Quality of Life Pack
The QoL Pack is a Modpack for Friday Night Funkin': FPS Plus.

Major additions include:
- *Test* once again being playable, being recharted by myself as no chart file actually exists. You can access it in the 'Secret' tab in Freeplay.
-- *Chart is not 100% accurate.*

- More Alt Instrumentals to choose from, like the placeholder versions of *Dad Battle (Pico Mix)* and *Guns (Pico Mix)*, or the 'LONER 2021' mix of *Ugh*.

- Re-added Pico-Dark's Hey animation, along with adding playAnim events to *Bopeebo (Pico Mix)*, *Dad Battle (Pico Mix)*, and *Spookeez (Pico Mix)*.

- Minuscule re-charts of all of Pico's Week 1 remixes and *Spookeez (Pico Mix)*.
-- *This is due to the aforementioned Hey animations and playAnim events and the ending to Fresh (Pico Mix).*

TODO: ADD GAMEPLAY SCREENSHOTS OF TEST, THE ALT INSTS, SPOOKEEZ PICO HEY, THE IN-GAME MOD MENU. WRITE THE HOW TO INSTALL SECTION (MAYBE COPY FROM REDUX?)
