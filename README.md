# FPS Plus: The Quality of Life Pack
The QoL Pack is a Modpack for [Friday Night Funkin' FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public).

Major additions include:
- *Test* finally being playable on FPS Plus, being recharted by myself as no chart file actually exists. You can access it in the 'Secret' tab in Freeplay.

  - *Chart is not 100% accurate.*

- More Alt Instrumentals to choose from, like the placeholder versions of *Dad Battle (Pico Mix)* and *Guns (Pico Mix)*, and the 'LONER 2021' mix of *Ugh*.

- Re-added Pico-Dark's Hey animation, along with adding playAnim events to *Bopeebo (Pico Mix)*, *Dad Battle (Pico Mix)*, and *Spookeez (Pico Mix)*.

- Minuscule re-charts of all of Pico's Week 1 remixes and *Spookeez (Pico Mix)*.

  - *This is due to the aforementioned Hey animations, playAnim events, and the ending to Fresh (Pico Mix).*
 
# Installation

It's simple. Just click the green `<> Code` button up at the top and then click `Download ZIP` in the dropdown menu.

Once the file finishes installing, extract the zip to the `mods` folder inside of your FPS Plus installation.

---

Your installation folder should look something like this:

```
-assets
-manifest
-plugins
-mods
 |-FPSPlus_theQoLPack-main        [<--- This is where you extracted the zip!]
-alsoft.ini
-FunkinFPSPlus.exe
-libvlc.dll
-libvlccore.dll
-lime.ndll
```

Feel free to remove the `art` folder along with the `.gitattributes` and `README.md` files inside the modpack once you've installed it correctly.
